# Implementation Order for MPC GitHub Python

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅
1. `repository.py` ✅
   - Rationale: Most basic operations that other modules depend on
   - Core functionality: create/search/fork repositories
   - Minimal external dependencies
   - Required for testing all other modules

2. `files.py` ✅
   - Rationale: Fundamental file operations needed by other modules
   - Core functionality: read/write/update files
   - Required for content management
   - Needed for testing other operations

## Phase 2: Basic Operations ✅
3. `branches.py` ✅
   - Rationale: Required for most Git operations
   - Depends on repository module
   - Needed for PR and commit operations

4. `commits.py` ✅
   - Rationale: Basic Git operations
   - Depends on branches and files
   - Required for PR operations

## Phase 3: Advanced Features ✅
5. `issues.py` ✅
   - Rationale: Independent feature set
   - Minimal dependencies on other modules
   - Can be tested independently

6. `pulls.py` ✅
   - Rationale: Complex operations
   - Depends on branches, commits, and files
   - Requires most other modules to be working

7. `actions.py` ✅
   - Rationale: CI/CD integration
   - Can be implemented independently
   - Not a blocker for other features

8. `search.py` ✅
   - Rationale: Utility feature
   - Can be implemented last
   - Independent of other modules
   - Enhances existing functionality

## Implementation Notes

### Dependencies Graph
```
repository.py <- files.py <- branches.py <- commits.py <- pulls.py
                                       └── issues.py
                                       └── actions.py
                                       └── search.py
```

### Testing Strategy ✅
- Each module should be implemented with its test suite
- Integration tests should be added as dependencies are satisfied
- Mock responses for GitHub API calls should be created for each module

### Priority Considerations ✅
1. Core Infrastructure (Phase 1)
   - Essential for all other operations
   - Should be thoroughly tested
   - Focus on robustness and error handling

2. Basic Operations (Phase 2)
   - Build on core infrastructure
   - Enable basic Git workflows
   - Required for most user scenarios

3. Advanced Features (Phase 3)
   - Can be implemented incrementally
   - Less critical for basic functionality
   - Allow for feature-based releases

### Implementation Tips ✅
- Start with type definitions and schemas for each module
- Implement basic CRUD operations first
- Add advanced features incrementally
- Focus on error handling and edge cases
- Maintain consistent API design across modules

### Next Steps
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- [ ] Create health check endpoints
- [ ] Perform security audit
- [ ] Conduct performance testing
- [ ] Create release documentation
